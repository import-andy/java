        int - 32 bits: [2^-31; 2^31]
        long - 64 bits: [2^-63; 2^63]
        float - 1 + 8 + 23 bit floating-point number: [2^-149; (2-2^-23)2^127]
        double - 1 + 11 + 52 bit floating-point number:  [2^1074; (2-2^-52)2^1023]
        char - Unicode character, 16 bits
    These are numeric convertible types.
    Represented by a sequence of bits (0 and 1).
    Default value is zero.

        Should always be private.
        Are given default values:
            boolean: false
            numeric: 0
            objects: null
    2. Local Variables:
        Local variables have local scope.
